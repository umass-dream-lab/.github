Welcome to the DREAM Lab at the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/), [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/).  
We focus on building systems for efficiently and securely managing data. 
We work on diverse topics, including probabilistic databases, privacy-preserving data analysis, mining and analysis of social networks and graph data, secure database architectures, database auditing, data stream processing, sensor data management, flash-based database management, provenance, causality, reverse data management, diversity and fairness, among others.
